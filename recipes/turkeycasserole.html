            <li>6 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can cream of mushroom soup</li>
            <li>1 (10.75 ounce) can milk</li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) can mushrooms</li>
            <li>3 cups diced cooked turkey</li>
            <li>1 (4 ounce) jar chopped pimento peppers</li>
            <li>Â½ cup slivered almonds</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup soft bread crumbs</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; 
                cook celery at a boil until tender, 5 to 10 minutes; drain.</li>
            <li>Heat butter in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir onion and bell pepper in the
                melted butter until softened, 5 to 10 minutes. Whisk flour into the onion mixture until
                the butter and flour form a paste. Add mushroom soup, milk, and mushrooms; cook,
                stirring occasionally, until mixture is smooth, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Mix turkey, celery, pimento peppers, almonds, and salt into mushroom soup mixture;
                cook and stir until heated through, about 5 minutes. Pour mixture into a 2-quart
                casserole dish; top with bread crumbs and Cheddar cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until casserole is bubbling and cheese is melted, 30 to 40.
                minutes.</li>
